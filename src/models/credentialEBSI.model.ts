/** CredentialEBSI uses EBSI proofs (JWS) and both W3C Credential v1 and v2 'iat', 'nbf' and 'exp'
 *  see https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/

 *  Implementers are advised that the "validFrom" and "issued" properties are reserved and use for any other purpose is discouraged.
 *  Note 2: It is expected that the next version of the specification will add the "validUntil" property in a way that deprecates,
 *  but preserves backwards compatibility with the "expirationDate" property.
 *  Implementers are advised that the "validUntil" property is reserved and its use for any other purpose is discouraged.
